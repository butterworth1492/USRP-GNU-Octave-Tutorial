USRP-GNU-Octave-Tutorial
========================

STANDARD DISCLAIMER: Unlike most people who commit code to github, my 
primary motivation is simply to find a place for interesting code to live 
if I don't want to lose track of it.  You'll find my coding styles vary 
from project to project and that I pay little attention to community 
standards or feedback.  I do all that stuff at my day job.  Enjoy!  


These are some training pages I threw together in grad school giving
descriptions and basic examples for reverse engineering wireless signals 
using GNU Octave with the Universal Serial Radio Peripheral (USRP). They 
include installation notes, tips on running the apps, techniques for
decoding a couple of modulation schemes, usable scripts, and some images.
