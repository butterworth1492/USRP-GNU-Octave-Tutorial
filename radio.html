      As with everything, your miles may very.
      Please feel free to let me know if there's something that you know and I don't because I'm
      always looking to improve my understanding of the tools and techniques.  If you can do it
      faster and/or better, I'd like to hear about it.

      The following are three graphical utilities that will allow you to scrutinize your signal(s).  They
      are all written in Python.  
      <ul>
        <li>
          The FFT (frequency domain)
          <div class="description">
            user> <span class="command">uhd_fft -f &lt;center frequency&gt; </span>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          The oscilloscope (time domain)
          <div class="description">
            user> <span class="command">uhd_fft -f &lt;center frequency&gt; -S </span>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          The waterfall display (time/frequency domain)
          <div class="description">
            user> <span class="command">uhd_fft -f &lt;center frequency&gt; -W </span>
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      For more options:
      <div class="description">
        user> <span class="command">uhd_fft -h</span>
      </div>
    </div>

      <span class="bold">Tip #2: "Why are these 3 utilities frozen and useless when I run them?"</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Each time that I have installed this software (my first being about 5 months ago), these
      utilities barely worked.  The graphs would work but the GUI's were unresponsive and would
      have to be killed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      My theory for this is that the event engine that python is using (and I know nothing about python
      or these widgets) is either being overwhelmed or starved by the other processing that the app is doing.  
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="bold">My solution:</span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I was able to control this issue by explicitly using lower values for the 
      <span class="bold">fft-size</span> and <span class="bold">fft-rate</span> at the command
      line.
      <div class="description">
        user> <span class="command"> uhd_fft --fft-size=512 --fft-rate=15 -f &lt;center frequency&gt; </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      For me, this solution was a tad tedious so  I created bash aliases.
      <div class="description">
        user> <span class="command"> vi .bashrc </span> <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;function fft <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uhd_fft --fft-size=512 --fft-rate=15 ${*} <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} <br/>
      </div>
      <br/>
      All subsequent logins will be able to use this.
      <div class="description">
        user> <span class="command"> fft -f &lt;center frequency&gt; &lt;other arguments&gt;</span> <br/>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #3: Capturing signals</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <span class="bold">uhd_rx_cfile</span> is used for capturing a file from the 
      command line.  use <span class="bold">uhd_rx_cfile -h</span> to get the full list of options.
      The following is an example that creates a file called <span class="bold">capture.raw</span>:
      <div class="description">
        user> <span class="command"> uhd_rx_cfile --samp-rate=4M -f 13.56M  -N 20M capture.raw</span>
      </div>
      This command will capture 5 seconds worth of 13.56Mhz signal at 4Mhz sampling.
    </div>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      If you're like me, you're going to want to do as much work as possible from the command line.
      however, for many things, GRC makes life much simpler.  I'm not going to give a tutorial but
      am going to recommend learning it.  Check out some of the links that I supplied on the index
      page.
