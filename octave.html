      <span class="bold">Tip #1: How to use Octave</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For anyone who's not used software like this before, it'll be a new experience.  However, for
      those coming from the Matlab world, Octave tries to maintain itself as a drop-in replacement.
      The syntax is nearly identical and many Matlab scripts can be run as-is through Octave.  I've
      often looked at Matlab code on the Internet that helped me get my Octave code working.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And, for all else, there's the online Octave documentation:
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/">http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/</a>
    </div>



    <a name="2"/>
    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #2: Reading USRP data files</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The USRP stores captured signal values as complex I/Q pairs, all of which are 32-bit floats. <br/>
      <div class="description">
      I1<br/>
      Q1<br/>
      I2<br/>
      Q2<br/>
      I3<br/>
      Q3<br/>
      (etc)
      </div>
      <br/>
      One of the Octave functions that you have access to (since you added the USRP stuff to your
      Octave path) is <span class="bold">read_float_binary()</span>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      To read in the data from the file:<br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">data = read_float_binary("data_file.raw");</span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      You may find it useful to seperate the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) portions:<br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">I = data(1:2:length(data)-1);</span><br/>
        octave> <span class="command">Q = data(2:2:length(data));</span><br/>
      </div>
      <br/>
      You can then process each seperately or create a vector of complex numbers:<br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">C = complex(I,Q);</span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Also, you'll want to get rid of the "USRP spike".  This is the name that my colleague gave the
      unexplained spikes in amplitude at the very beginning of the captures.
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">data(1:500) = [];</span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      It may just be simpler to use this simple function that I wrote.  
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">[complex_data,N] = <a href="scripts/build_signal.m">build_signal</a>(usrp_data);</span> <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        complex_data = complex signal <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        N = # of samples
      </div>
    </div>



    <a name="3"/>
    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #3: Memory management and processing</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I've had very little experience using Matlab but, from what I've seen, the experience is very similar
      between it and Octave.  One major difference that I've seen is the processing capability.  Matlab
      appears to be able to process large data sets significantly more quickly and never seems to have
      memory issues (again, from my limited experience).  Octave, on the other hand, appears to have
      linear performance in that there is a direct correlation between the size of the data set and the
      amount of processing time.  Large data sets can also cause two problems:
      <ol>
        <li> Octave will complain about lack of memory. </li>
        <li> Octave, by default, uses GNURadio as its graphical plotting medium.  The two communicate through a named pipe and I have noticed that large data sets will "make that pipe blow up" and GNU Plot will not function properly in such instances.</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      <span class="bold">My solutions:</span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          I work around this issue by carving up the data files into discrete units to be processed 
          independently. I use <a href="http://www.cse.sc.edu/~mille457/usrp/scripts/make_chop_signal.m">this</a> script to do so.  It
          works by having the user hover the mouse over the plot and enter the X coordinates into
          the terminal and allowing each chunk to be saved individually.  Click <a href="images/make_chop.png">here</a>
          for a picture.
        </li>
        <li> 
          Down sampling. If you're wanting to do a quick check of a plot, cut down on the number
          of samples that you're viewing on the time domain.<br/>
          Instead of: <br/>
          <div class="description">
            octave> <span class="command">plot(data);</span> <br/>
          </div>
          Try: <br/>
          <div class="description">
            octave> <span class="command">data = data(1:8:length(data));</span> <br/>
            octave> <span class="command">plot(data);</span>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li> 
          Using the FLTK described <a href="octave.html#6">here</a>.  It is not an external program and thus
          doesn't suffer from the IPC issues that GNUPlot/Octave seem to.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      This may seem like a touch much, but once integrated into your routine, it's not bad at all and
      it still allows you to avoid the hefty Matlab pricetag by using a free (and ever-evolving) 
      alternative.
    </div>


    <a name="4"/>
    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #4: Looking for ASK</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      One of the first and most useful things I learned (since it was relevent to my task at the time)
      is how to plot a signal's magnitude while stripping out all of the data.  It was very handy in 
      being able to identify ASK modulation.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">C = complex(I,Q); </span> <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">plot( abs(C) ); </span>
      </div>
      <br/>
      It's just that simple.
    </div>


    <a name="5"/>
    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #5: A very basic spectrogram</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      At some point, you may need to generate a spectrogram.  Octave mirrors the Matlab functions
      for doing so. This is a <span class="bold">very</span> basic example for doing so. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">data = read_float_binary("data_file.raw");</span> % Read in from file <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">[data,N] = <a href="scripts/build_signal.m">build_signal</a>(data);</span> % Make the complex signal <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">I = real(data);</span> % Grab in-phase component <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">colormap("jet");</span> % Choose the color scheme <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">colorbar("northoutside");</span> % The amplitude legend <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">specgram( I, 1024, 4e6);</span> % Generate the spectrogram <br/>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Click <a href="images/specgram.png">here</a> for an image of the output.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/signal/function/specgram.html">specgram()</a> accepts five arguments, only three of which I've used here and only one of which is required. <br/>
      <div class="description">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        arg1: The vector we are plotting. <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        arg2: Size of the FFT window ( [] for default=256 ).  Practically speaking, can be used to control color "intensity". <br/>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        arg3: Sample rate ( [] for default=2Hz ).  Practically speaking, is used to control domain/range of axes.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <a href="http://www.obihiro.ac.jp/~suzukim/masuda/octave/html/octave_137.html">colormap()</a> is used to determine the color scheme.  A list of available maps 
      (along with other useful functions) can be found 
      <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/colormap.html">here</a>.  "Jet" is the default map unless
      specified otherwise.  
      <br/> 
      <br/>
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/doc/interpreter/Plot-Annotations.html">colorbar()</a> is used to 
      include/place the amplitude legend. <br/> 
    </div>



    <a name="6"/>
    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #6: Using FLTK instead of GNUPlot </span>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      GNUPlot is the default plotting program for Octave.  However, the Octave community is slowly transitioning to an internal
      OpenGL-based plotting substitute that uses <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">graphics_toolkit("fltk");</span> <br/>
      <br/>
        This can be done from the Octave command line or specified in any of the octave config files to load by default (such
        as ~/.octaverc).
      </div>
      <br/>
      Thus far, I have found FLTK to be lacking in functionality compared to GNUPlot.  However, it plots significantly
      faster, doesn't require any of the downsample trickery mentioned above, and supports panning (which is a huge bonus).  If you
      have the patience, and can stand some quirks, then I'd check it out.
    </div>


    <a name="7"/>
    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #7: Looking for FSK</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I have not yet had the opportunity to identify any FSK-modulated signals.  However, 
      I have browsed some sample code on how to do so.  It involves looking for differences
      in signal phase.  Unfortunately, the following code is "as provided" and un-vetted by
      me.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div class="description">
        octave> <span class="command">dphi = diff(unwrap(angle(SIGNAL)));</span> <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">plot( dphi*fs/(2*pi),'b');</span> <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">xlabel('Sample');</span> <br/>
        octave> <span class="command">ylabel('Inst Freq (Hz)');</span> <br/>
      </div>
      <br/>
      Hope this helps.
    </div>

    <div class="section center">
      <span class="bold">Tip #8: Plotting frequency response</span> 
      <br/>
      <br/>
        The ability to see the effects of a filter before applying it is very useful.
        <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/octave/function/freqz.html">freqz()</a> does
        such a thing. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div class="description">
