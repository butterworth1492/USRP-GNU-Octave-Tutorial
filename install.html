      How to install GNU Radio/Octave.  My platform of choice was Fedora Core 14 (Linux-x86)  For all

      <span class="bold">Assumptions:</span> <br/>
      <ul>
        <li> You've installed FC 14. </li>
        <li> You're up to date with all of your packages. (<span class="bold">yum update</span>)</li>

      <br/>
      <span class="bold">Notes:</span> <br/>
      <ul>
        <li> 
          This should work with little deviation for most distros and versions (although you may need
          to work on the package management a bit).

            Typically, I try to stick with my linux distro's package management for installations and

            Depending on hardware and network speed, this installation could take a couple of hours.  
            I have yet to have an issue with this script and therefore can't report on workarounds
            for potentially common problems.  The one thing that I don't particularly like about this
            script is that it doesn't seem to have a facility for uninstalling the software.  Be forewarned.
